# HassOS SSH port 22222 Configurator

Maintains an `authorized_keys` file in the location required by HAOS at boot time to enable the SSH port 22222.

You can connect an SDCard and up to two hard disks or USB drives, which are detected as sda or sdb, and they will all have HAOS SSH port 22222 enabled.

## Support

**No support is provided.**

This is a fork of the addon from <https://github.com/adamoutler/HassOSConfigurator> customised for my purposes. If you want help, use the original addon.

## Operation

**Important Note** when requested to reboot, choose Supervisor -> Reboot Host or pull the power plug from your machine and restart it.

Hit the start button and observe the logs.
